# CTF-Competition-Practice

## CTF Competition Preparation - Starting from December 13th, 2023.
1. During university, solve at least one to two Bugku CTF or XCTF problems daily (Web, Crypto, Misc and Reverse)
2. Pick one topic each week to learn, and store the learning code in /Learning
3. Irregularly pick an AIS3 CTF or other certification, competition to do timed problem-solving, and record the scores, problem-solving process, and make-up problems (refers to solving the problems that were not completed during the contest)
4. Create a /toolbox folder in the repository to store various tools used for competitions and problem-solving. This will include utilities and scripts that assist in efficiently tackling CTF challenges.
